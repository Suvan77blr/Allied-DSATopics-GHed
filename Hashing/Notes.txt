* Hashing - prestore something and fetch it when required.

* number hashing : 
    - in the main : 10^7 is the max size.
    - in global space : 10^8 is the max size.

* character hashing : 
    - hashArr[ch - 'a'] : lowercase only. => hashArr has 26 size.
    - hashArr[ch - 'A'] : uppercase only.
    - hashArr[ch] : all possible ASCII characters. => hashArr has all 256 character count.
        ch will auto-cast itself to its ASCII code.


* STL -> map, unordered_map.
* Collections -> HashMap.


* Map -
    => O(logN)
    - Stores all elements in sorted order.

* Unordered Map -
    => O(1) Best,Avg (OR) O(N) Worst Case.


-> Hashing :-
Three methods of implementation -
    
    * Division Method => modulus of some size if used.
        - Collision => linear chaining of values which get the same 'mod'.

    * Folding Method
    * Mid Square Method

* Datatypes for the key :
    - UMP supports only int, double, char & string.
    - Map supports any datatypes. Those which are nested or comprising of STL containers too.
